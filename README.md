# Heart Center Neonatal Sedation Guideline

A clinical decision-support tool for sedation and analgesia management in intubated neonates (< 30 days) before and after cardiac surgery.

## Overview

This guideline provides structured, evidence-based pathways for bedside sedation management in the cardiac ICU. It is built as a single-page interactive HTML reference designed for use on any device.

### Pathways

- **Post-Surgery Pathway** — Scope, starting regimen, score-driven escalation (rFLACC for pain, SBS for sedation), and rescue agents
- **IV → Enteral Bridge** — Criteria and wean timelines for transitioning from dexmedetomidine (→ clonidine) and IV opioids (→ enteral morphine/methadone)
- **Dosing Reference** — Complete dosing ranges and titration increments for all agents

### Key Features

- Score-driven escalation using SBS and rFLACC assessments
- RN-directed and provider-level steps clearly labeled
- Opioid rotation guidelines with pharmacy consultation
- Non-pharmacologic measures integrated as a parallel reminder
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
